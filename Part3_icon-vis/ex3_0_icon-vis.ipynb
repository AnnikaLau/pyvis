    "# Exercise 3.0: icon-vis\n",
    "prepared by A. Lauber\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will work with the GitHub repository [icon-vis](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis), which was developed by C2SM and MeteoSwiss. It is a collection of easy-to-use Python scripts for plotting data on unstructured grids like the ICON grid. It is based on the library [psyplot](https://psyplot.github.io), which was already introduced in [Exercise 2.2](../Part2_Mapplots/ex2_2_psyplot.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of plotting on the unstructured grid:\n",
    "- Shows the real output without interpolation\n",
    "- No preprocessing of the data necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of plotting on the unstructured grid:\n",
    "- It can be quite slow depending on the size of your netCDF file\n",
    "- Not all features are available yet (psyplot is still under development)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use icon-vis on your own machine, please follow the [installation instruction](https://github.com/C2SM/icon-vis#environment-setup) in the README. For this course, an environment is already prepared for you to save time."
